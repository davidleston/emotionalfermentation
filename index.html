      <p>Hi friends, Iâ€™m working towards becoming an intimacy coach for individuals and relationships and offering practice sessions.</p>
      <p>I aim to bring light and words to the areas of ourselves that are generally hidden. 
        Through vulnerable authentic relating and experiential practices, we can make connections with things we know about ourselves 
        but we don't always remember.</p>
        <p>I also just plain enjoy geeking out with people about boundaries, vulnerability, discovering and expressing desires, 
        and navigating different relationship styles. I may at some point burst into song.</p>
       
      <p>Please pick a time that works for you below.  
       Sessions will be over zoom with a link in your appointment confirmation email. Times are PST.</p>
      <p>If you feel moved from any shifts that happen in session and wish to give back, do so <a href="https://venmo.com/u/scobygoo">here</a>. 
        Gratitude and appreciations 
      </p>
