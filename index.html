      <p>Hi, I’m Scoby! I’m a Certified Cuddle Party Facilitator and host Cuddle Parties about once a month. They’re really communication and consent workshops. I’m super passionate about them and love sharing the practices of asking for what you want and stating your boundaries powerfully in a non-sexual space. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/o/scoby-35004416623">Follow me here</a> to learn about upcoming events. </p>
        <p>I also offer experiential relationship and intimacy coaching. Topics include ethical non-monogamy, embodiment, releasing shame, and strengthening communicating desires and healthy boundaries. As someone actively unlearning “other peoples emotions are more important than mine”, I’m passionate about helping others also learn how to redirect their energy from worrying about what other people think, and instead focus on how to express themselves with compassion and awareness. You can book a free exploratory session with me below</p>
       
      <p> 
       Sessions will be over zoom with a link in your appointment confirmation email. </p>
      <p>If you feel moved from any shifts that happen in session and wish to give back, you can do so <a href="https://venmo.com/u/scobygoo">here</a>. 
        Big love and hugs (if you're a yes)
      </p>
