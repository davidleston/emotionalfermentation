      <p>Hi, I’m Scoby! I’m named after the Symbiotic Colony Of Bacteria and Yeast used as a starter in fermentation processes. For the last 5+ years, I have been embracing and embodying Scoby themes of growth, transformation, balance, alchemy, and being a catalyst for others. I love bringing together people, facilitating new experiences, and seeing what change occurs thereafter. I do this through Cuddle Parties and coaching! </p>
      <p><b>Cuddle Parties </b></p>
<p>I host Cuddle Parties about once a month. These “parties” are all about communication and consent. I’m super passionate about them! They are a fun, non-sexual space to practice  asking for what you want and stating your boundaries powerfully. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/o/scoby-35004416623">Follow me here</a> to learn about upcoming events.

       <p><b>Relationship and Intimacy Coaching </b></p>
        <p>
I also offer experiential relationship and intimacy coaching. Topics include:
<br>- Embodiment
<br>- Releasing shame
<br>- Communicating desires  
<br>- Nurturing healthy boundaries
<br>I am actively unlearning the idea that “other people’s emotions are more important than mine,” so I’m passionate about helping others on this journey! In sessions, I help clients unplug from worry about what other people think, and shift focus to expressing themselves with compassion and awareness. </p>
<p>You can book a free exploratory session over Zoom with me by emailing scobygoo at geemail... see what I did there...;)  </p>
      <p>Big love and hugs!</p>
